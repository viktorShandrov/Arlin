            "content": "Like many people, Taylor Swift grew up listening to Paul McCartney , but unlike most, she has had the opportunity to meet him. Swift is friends with McCartney‚Äôs daughter, Stella McCartney, and had a lengthy conversation with him for an interview. When Swift met him, she asked him to sign a paper with her favorite lyrics. They‚Äôre from a classic Beatles song, and the paper is now hanging in her bathroom. Taylor Swift has Paul McCartney lyrics hanging in her bathroom When Swift met McCartney for Rolling Stone‚Äôs Musicians on Musicians series in 2020, she asked him for a favor. ‚ÄúWe walk into his office for a chat, and after I make a nervous request, Paul is kind enough to handwrite my favorite lyric of his and sign it,‚Äù Swift wrote. ‚ÄúHe makes a joke about me selling it, and I laugh because it‚Äôs something I know I‚Äôll cherish for the rest of my life .‚Äù In 2023, Time Magazine named Swift its Person of the Year. Though she didn‚Äôt identify the cherished McCartney lyric in her Rolling Stone article, she revealed to Time that the lyric is from the Beatles song ‚ÄúBlackbird.‚Äù The signed note reads, ‚ÄúTake these broken wings and learn to fly.‚Äù Taylor Swift said she learned about her own career from Paul McCartney Swift saw McCartney in concert and walked away with a lesson on how to handle her own career . ‚ÄúI went with my family to see you in concert in 2010 or 2011, and the thing I took away from the show most was that it was the most selfless set list I had ever seen,‚Äù Swift said. ‚ÄúIt was completely geared toward what it would thrill us to hear. It had new stuff, but it had every hit we wanted to hear, every song we‚Äôd ever cried to, every song people had gotten married to, or been brokenhearted to. And I just remembered thinking, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got to remember that,‚Äô that you do that set list for your fans.‚Äù She realized that part of her job is to play the songs her fans most want to hear. ‚ÄúI think that learning that lesson from you taught me at a really important stage in my career that if people want to hear ‚ÄòLove Story‚Äô and ‚ÄòShake It Off,‚Äô and I‚Äôve played them 300 million times, play them the 300-millionth-and-first time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think there are times to be selfish in your career, and times to be selfless, and sometimes they line up.‚Äù She has another gift from a classic artist in her home McCartney is not the only artist who has gifted Swift something she keeps on display in her home. Stevie Nicks, who has often praised Swift , sent her a Stevie Nicks Barbie doll. According to Time, it sits in Swift‚Äôs kitchen. Swift said she learned a lot from McCartney. Nicks, however, doesn‚Äôt think she should even try to teach the younger musician about fame. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give Taylor advice about being famous,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt need it.‚Äù",

More than 40 departments attended the conference focused on fighting back against violent crime. A CBS 17 crew also attended the conference but was not allowed inside the sessions. Fayetteville Police Chief Kem Braden told CBS 17 that he made the goal of bringing in instructors from across the country and making sure neighboring law enforcement had the same kind of preparation. ‚ÄúWhere does Cumberland County start and Fayetteville end? Criminals don‚Äôt understand those boundaries so I think it‚Äôs important we all are on the same sheet of music to what our response to violent crime is going to be.‚Äù Braden says while violent crime in Fayetteville is down nine percent from last year, homicide and domestic violence numbers are up. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre trying to understand the latest trends of how violent criminals are operating, like through social media and other forms of technology. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to stay at the forefront on being innovative on how we approach crime.‚Äù The police department says officers from six federal agencies are also attending today‚Äôs conference, which runs through Thursday.",
